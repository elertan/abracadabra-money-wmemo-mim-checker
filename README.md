# abracadabra-money-wmemo-mim-checker
Refreshes the page and notifies whenever the amount wMEMO - MIM is not 0

Uses NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) to start a bot which checks the availability of MIMs.
I would not advise to use this bot unless you can read the source, therefore I won't provide more instructions.

Does not use your Metamask account, instead it creates a dummy one.

I am not liable for any damages caused if you choose to use this project.
